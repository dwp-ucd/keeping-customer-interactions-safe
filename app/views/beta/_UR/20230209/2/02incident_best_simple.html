          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Why was the customer in contact with us?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">The customer came in for his fortnightly meeting to provide an update on his search for work. The customer appeared like he was under the influence of alcohol. In his hand was a bottle which contained a red liquid later confirmed to be alcohol, possibly red wine. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. How did the incident start? Was there a specific trigger?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">He signed in and sat down to await his time. I was running slightly late due to the previous appointment over running. Whilst sitting down he was sipping from an unlabelled bottle. When he was called, he seemed a bit unstable and staggered towards me. I asked how he was and at that time, I smelled alcohol on his breath. He flopped on the chair saying “I have been fucking looking for work you are damned for making come here every time. That bastard Peter now sends me to you. What are you going to do?” I replied, I will try and help me as much as I can however, he needs to desist from swearing. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. What were the issues with the customer's behaviour?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">He was swearing and appeared drunk. He should not be seen in this state
          </p>
          <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible" aria-hidden="true">
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4. Tell us what happened next. How did you try to resolve the situation, and how did the customer react?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">
           I replied, I will try and help as much as I can however, he needs to desist from swearing. He got up and asked, “what are you going to do if I don’t”? I responded it would be best if he got a good outcome from his visit. He suddenly pushed his chair back, it fell on the floor, he threw the content from his bottle at me which landed on the table.

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">6. How did your interaction with the customer end?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">The customer walked out of the centre when he observed the customer care agent approach us. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">7. How did you feel during the incident?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">I was badly shaken by the turn of events, fearful of the liquid thrown at me as I did not know what he held in his hand. It made me feel vulnerable and at risk of danger

          <p class="govuk-body">Staff was shaken by the turn of events and had to take the rest of their shift off. It was confirmed the liquid thrown was red wine. The customer should not have been signed in the first place as he seemed under the influence of alcohol. Staff debrief took place to prevent incidents taking place. There was no witness that actually saw and heard what was said at the time, although there were other staff around, no one could give an account of what happened.Staff acted appropriately under the circumstances. The customer is a regular that thrown tantrums from time to time. This is a serious incident, and I would recommend they are banned from visiting the JC for some time.</p>
