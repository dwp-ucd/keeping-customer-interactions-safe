          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. What were the issues with the customer's behaviour?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Customer called requesting to speak to a supervisor stating how dare we stop her benefit because she took on a job that was short-lived of about 10days. She didn’t want to speak to no senseless prick bastard. I told her I could give her an explanation to how this has occurred and steps to reinstate her payments. Customer screamed “I don’t want to talk to you bastard, you have nothing to offer me. Put me on a call to someone that can make a decision now. I am coming down there to knock your teeth out”.
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4. Tell us what happened next. How did you try to resolve the situation, and how did the customer react?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">
           I was lost for words and said I would get my supervisor to call her back. She replied “You had better”. I contacted my team leader via teams of the incident and needed some time out. I was shaken by it all.

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">7. How did you feel during the incident?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">I stunned and really in a confused state as to how she could behave like that. Being called names was unpleasant, I was in shock and needed sometime to process what had happened. It made me frightful of continuing my shift.
