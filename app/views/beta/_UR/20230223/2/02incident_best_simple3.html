          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Why was the customer in contact with us?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">WEBCHAT- the paying parent wanted to know how his payments are worked out and that his income had gone down £8000 but his payment had gone up. he explained that the qualifying children he is paying for are now adults and feels like he should not be paying for them. I explained that the schedule is based on his income and asked him questions regarding his income, which he ignored.

          <p class="govuk-body">He went on to say; that we are a Nazi organisation and what we are doing is criminal, because he cannot afford his rent and has to reply on food banks. He said the figures we have charged him are eye watering and he could have bought a house. He explains we could make him homeless and he has to rely on food banks. </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">He explained- 'whoever decided I should pay more from your organisation, I hope they step on lego everyday for the rest of their life'

          <p class="govuk-body">I was in the office with XXXXX when she was chatting to this customer through our online WebChat service.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">She was visibly shaken at the comments around "a Nazi organisation". Despite this, XXXXX was concerned for the clients welfare and arranged for a manager to call him to discuss his case and ensure he was ok. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">I have listened to some of the call a colleague made and despite the opening introduction of "I am calling because my colleague was concerned" the client was hostile throughout the hour long call. (NB there was no unacceptable behaviour exhibited during the parts of the call I listened to).</p>
<p class="govuk-body">XXXXX received support from myself and colleagues during the WebChat as she was left unable to think straight due to the comments made by the client. Once the WebChat ended, XXXXX had to take an extended break to compose herself enough to deal with the next customer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">I feel a verbal warning should be issued to this client regarding his behaviour and choice of words.
