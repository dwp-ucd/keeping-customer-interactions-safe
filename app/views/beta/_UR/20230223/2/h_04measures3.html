      <p class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-7">Customer referred after abusive and unacceptable comments were made during the web chat with CMG colleague - a return call was made as original colleague was concerned for the customer and whilst no unacceptable behaviour was demonstrated, customer was challenging and shouting throughout. Financial stress seems to be a trigger but to call DWP a Nazi organisation and to make reference to a decision maker having to suffer stepping on lego for the rest of their lives, describes a wish for pain to be visited upon them. No swearing and no direct threat. This is the first time this customer has been referred - I agree with the LM in that a verbal warning should be delivered now that he has had a few days to reflect. I would ask the LM to deliver this and let us know when this has been done as well as any outcomes. </p>
