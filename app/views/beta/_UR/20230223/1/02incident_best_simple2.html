          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Why was the customer in contact with us?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Claimant attended his appointment to end existing sanctions on 1 December 2022 at 11:30am
          </p>
          <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible" aria-hidden="true">
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. How did the incident start? Was there a specific trigger?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">He initially went to use the computers (WADS) at the Jobcentre however security came over and asked him to come off the computer. He was 2 hours late for this appointment and arrived at 13:30. I began to explain the process of ending the sanction. Claimant asked lots of questions regarding how much money he would lose, when he could get a hardship payment and also asked for a phone. I explained I would tell the claimant once I had worked out the answers about his pay and advised we wouldn't give him a phone since he had already had one from 22nd March 2022. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. What were the issues with the customer's behaviour?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Claimant then made the "wanker" hand gesture. I told the claimant I could see what he was doing and if he continued to display inappropriate behaviour I would ask him to leave and not end the sanction. Claimant became disinterested and started to look around the room. He then put his hand down his shorts and clearly continued the hand gesture while holding his penis.
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4. Tell us what happened next. How did you try to resolve the situation, and how did the customer react?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            I saw this and said to the claimant "that's disgusting stop that". The claimant stopped, stood up, turned around and put his hand down the back of his shorts, pulling them down slightly as he did this to reveal his backside a little. I told the claimant to sit down and conduct himself appropriately. I explained that kind of behaviour was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated.

          <p class="govuk-body">This incident was brought to my attention by security guards after the customer has left the building. I have spoken to the work coach XXXXX who has not been unduly affected by the incident. XXXXX stated he did not actually see the customers penis but was well aware of the action the customer was doing. XXXXX did not raise the alarm but asked the customer to stop what he was doing. The customer left the building without the need to be escorted off the premises. XXXXX has left the office early which was arranged prior to the incident. There is notes in the customers UC build relating to previous incidents but no UCB on record. I will investigate these and send any further info via email. An incident has been raised with the police. No customers saw what happened in the jobcentre. No other members of staff witnessed the incident. Security were only aware when they heard the work coach asking the customer to stop what they were doing as it was disgusting.</p>
