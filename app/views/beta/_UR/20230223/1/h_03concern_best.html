          <p class="govuk-body"><p>Reported by a CHDA doctor, 25 May 2022 16:00 </p>
          <p>During an examination, the customer repeatedly talked about ideation of hurting figures in authority. The customer described a scenario where they wanted to hit a work coach. The customer also said that they couldn’t be sure that they would be able to stop themselves from hurting people. They said they have hurt people before. They also mentioned that they have a large store of weapons at home ranging from kitchen knifes to baseball bats. In my opinion there is a significant risk that the customer may present a danger and some safety measures are required. </p>
