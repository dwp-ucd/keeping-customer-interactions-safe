          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Tell us about the incident</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">The customer was calling to chase up an advance payment as well as standard UC payment following them changing their bank details, this had caused the payment to be delayed as the change occurred on the same day that the payment was meant to be issued. After puttin customer on hold to be able to check through the claim in order to get a full scope of the issue, the customer became very agitated saying that we (DWP) were stealing his money. I tried to manage the situation explaining once the bank details are verified that the payment will be issued automatically. This was not received well and following aggravated discussions the customer and his friend (who was in the background) suggested that they should go and buy a knife to take to the job centre. The customer then proceeded to end the call on his side. I did not feel particulary threatened during the call but I was aware that there could be a risk to staff and the job centre.
