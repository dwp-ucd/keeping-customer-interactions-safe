          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Tell us about the incident</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">We received a journal message from the customer and he made threats to fellow public memebers and members of staffWe have already made it clear to you, in our journal, with doctor's note, Jason has severe mental health issues. WE have already told you, in our journal, in writing, and Physical Harm comes of Jason, or the Pople around him, INCLUDING and agents /staff on behalf of the UC. Will BE THE UC Fault. you have been warned. We can not take any form of liability for any violent outbursts or physical harm to your staff or Jason himself, Further, we can not take any liability towards any of your property. You are going put Jason in a stressful situation, he is going to react badly, and will not be able to deal with the people around him, nor will you understand his manner, /character/ behaviour. Jayne, carer, And its unlike any "questionnaire" will be filled in by him, he is already kicking off, he wants to come down and fight you now. Iam sorry to say this, but my dad is not well. The incident was prompted by being asked to supply a fit note with and end date. We tried to resolve the situation by contacting the customer on the journal as in previous journal messages and claimant history notes we had been advised not to contact customer on the phone. We were concerned that without a record of the customers behaviour he could attend his WCA appointment with an outside provider and there would be no record of his potentially violent outbursts. Interaction was a series of journal messages between the customers account and UC and the last one stated that they were going to make a formal complaint I was not affected too much by the journal messages but my role as a TL is to protect my colleagues so i completed the KCIS to ensure the behaviour was recorded.

          <p class="govuk-body">I have discussed this incident with the WC,have checked their wellbeing and offered them time away from their desk if required - this has been declined as deemed not necessary. I have informed the JCM and CCo's of the customers threats to attend the job centre and the potentially violent nature of threats. Although we are aware the customer has severe mental health condition we are still required to engage with the customer as part of our duty of care as well as ensuring we are providing the correct level of support for the customers current circumstances. Whilst on the health journey we can conduct appointments by phoneif customer is uncomfortable being around people however customer has expressed he doesn't want to be contacted by phone. He is also triggered by journal message contact. Consideration could be given for an appointee however feel it would be unsafe to send a Home Visiting Officer to collate the information required. Any interaction with the job centre in person should be via screened room to ensure safety of all staff and customers. Consider contacting care to discuss whether they would be wiling to become appointee to reduce further stress and incidents.  </p>
