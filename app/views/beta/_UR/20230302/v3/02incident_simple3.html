          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Tell us about the incident</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">We received a journal message from the customer and he made threats to fellow public memebers and members of staffWe have already made it clear to you, in our journal, with doctor's note, Jason has severe mental health issues. WE have already told you, in our journal, in writing, and Physical Harm comes of Jason, or the Pople around him, INCLUDING and agents /staff on behalf of the UC. Will BE THE UC Fault. you have been warned. We can not take any form of liability for any violent outbursts or physical harm to your staff or Jason himself, Further, we can not take any liability towards any of your property. You are going put Jason in a stressful situation, he is going to react badly, and will not be able to deal with the people around him, nor will you understand his manner, /character/ behaviour. Jayne, carer, And its unlike any "questionnaire" will be filled in by him, he is already kicking off, he wants to come down and fight you now. Iam sorry to say this, but my dad is not well. The incident was prompted by being asked to supply a fit note with and end date. We tried to resolve the situation by contacting the customer on the journal as in previous journal messages and claimant history notes we had been advised not to contact customer on the phone. We were concerned that without a record of the customers behaviour he could attend his WCA appointment with an outside provider and there would be no record of his potentially violent outbursts. Interaction was a series of journal messages between the customers account and UC and the last one stated that they were going to make a formal complaint I was not affected too much by the journal messages but my role as a TL is to protect my colleagues so i completed the KCIS to ensure the behaviour was recorded.
